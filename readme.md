# What should this have?

This is a base app on Middleman using the following:

## How to install!

You'll need to get all the gems up and running by cloning this application and then run bundle. This will download all the gems listed in `Gemfile`.

Once done, run middleman inside the root and the rest should be self explanatory.

## Done!

* HAML (marking up nicely)
* SCSS (styling)
* CoffeeScript (enhancing)
* Susy (for grids/layout)
* Light ruby back-end (for who knows what)
* Light tests (rspec/capybara)

## Upcoming

* Some kinda CI/Build passing thingy
* More Tests! (rspec/some phantom view/screengrabbing thingy)

## Other
* Use MarkDown for blog posts
